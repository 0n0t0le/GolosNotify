Steemification - Notifications for Steemit.com

Display desktop notifications once new votes and comments on Steemit.com are available
Steemification offers the long missing notifications from the social media platform steemit.com. The development is ongoing and the extension will be improved over time.

## Getting started:
* install the extension -> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blnmejicejbkcdebiobgfpjhopoahmen
* click on the steemit icon in your browser bar
* enter your account data
* let the notifications roll in

Any feedback for the notification may be posted via: https://steemit.com/@fleuri on the related blog post.

## Manually getting started:

* Download the files in the repository
* inside of Chrome go to chrome://extensions
* enable developer mode
* "load unpacked extension" 
* have fun 

## Be cautious

You should never install anything that you don't trust. This extension will be free forever and it will never ask for private keys or your password. The extension that is uploaded to the store is using the exact codebase as this extension here in the repository. I will only update it in the store once this code here is updated, live and audited.
